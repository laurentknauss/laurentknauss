 👋 👋  **Hi !   I am Laurent , remote-first French Golang developer (former NodeJS backend coder) living near the charming city of Versailles** . <br>
 <br>
  
 👀 **My main professional interests & endeavours are in the field of  coding distributed systems with a gRPC architecture and** <br>
  **use CNCF tools to monitor those . I also like to work with open-source  Key-Value stores such as LevelDB and its more feature-rich improvement : RocksDB** . 
 <br>
 

👨 👩 **My peers say that I have  currently a confirmed Golang level & currently honing my skills to soon take an  
exam to become a  'Prometheus Certified Associate'** .
<br>
&nbsp;  
🌱 **My stack of choice: microservices + gRPC + 'Prometheus-Grafana-Jaeger' trifecta + KV storage engines**.   <br>
